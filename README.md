# Handling Dependent Promises ðŸ”„

## Overview ðŸŒŸ

This code demonstrates how to work with dependent promises in JavaScript using async/await. It simulates the process of buying, soaking, and cooking beans, with each step being asynchronous. By handling these dependent promises, you'll learn how to manage asynchronous operations in a sequential manner.

## How to Use ðŸš€

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer.

2. Open your terminal.

3. Navigate to the directory containing your 'app.js' file.

4. Run the following command to execute the code:

```bash
node app.js
```	

This will start the process of buying, soaking, and cooking beans and display the final dinner message in your terminal.

## Covered Topics ðŸ“š

This code covers the following concepts:

- Asynchronous JavaScript: Demonstrates how to work with asynchronous operations using promises and async/await.

- Sequential Execution: Shows how to execute asynchronous tasks in a specific order, waiting for each to complete before moving to the next.

- Promises: Utilizes promises to handle asynchronous code cleanly and elegantly.

- Error Handling: Although not explicitly shown in this example, you can extend the code to include error handling for robust application development.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to gain a deeper understanding of handling dependent promises in JavaScript.
